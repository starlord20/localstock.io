# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how LocalStock.online ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our website at https://localstock.online (the "Site"). By using the Site you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

1. Scope
- This policy applies to information collected through the Site and any services we provide. It does not apply to third-party websites or services linked from the Site.

2. Information We Collect
- Information you provide directly: Search queries, ZIP/postal codes, contact form submissions, and any content you enter into the Site.
- Device and usage information: IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, pages visited, referrer URL, and timestamps.
- Location information: Approximate location inferred from IP address or precise location only if you explicitly grant browser/device geolocation permission.
- Third-party data: Information obtained from third-party services and APIs (for example, product availability and pricing from retailer APIs).

3. How We Use Information
- Provide and improve services: To respond to your searches, show nearby store availability and pricing, and personalize content.
- Analytics and monitoring: To analyze site usage, diagnose problems, and improve the Site.
- Affiliate and referral tracking: To route clicks through affiliate redirect endpoints and apply tracking parameters required by our partner programs.

4. Affiliate Links and Monetization
- Some links and buttons on the Site are affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission. Affiliate links do not change the price you pay.
- We may rewrite or route outbound retailer links through our affiliate redirect endpoint to ensure correct attribution to our affiliate partners.

5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
- We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies for session management, preferences, and analytics. Third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics) may set their own cookies.
- You can control cookies through your browser settings and opt out of certain analytics tracking where provided by the third-party service.

6. Sharing and Disclosure
- Service providers: We share data with trusted vendors who help operate the Site (hosting providers, analytics, email providers), under contractual restrictions.
- Legal and safety: We may disclose information to comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests, or to protect rights, property, safety, or to prevent fraud.

7. Data Retention
- We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy and to comply with legal obligations. Aggregated or anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for analytics.

8. Security
- We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no internet system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.

9. Your Rights and Choices
- Access and deletion: You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data by contacting privacy@localstock.online. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.
- Do Not Track: We do not currently honor browser "Do Not Track" signals for third-party analytics, though you can opt out of many analytics services directly.

10. International Transfers
- Our servers and service providers may be located in other countries. By using the Site you acknowledge that your data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your country of residence.

11. Children
- The Site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.

12. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this policy from time to time. We will post changes on this page and update the "Last updated" date.

13. Contact Us
